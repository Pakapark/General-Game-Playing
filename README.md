# GGP Java codebase for CS227B

This codebase is forked from the repo at ggp-org repo. It renames methods to match the notes for the Stanford CS227B course. It also includes files that allow for games with incomplete information (though this requires a bit of additional work to set up).

# Our Implementation
- MinMax Algorithm
- Monte Carlo Search
- Monte Carlo Tree Search (Optimized)
- PropNet
- Optimized Propnet

# Result
- Top ten out of more than 50 teams almost every week (rank #2 in some week and lost to rank #1 because of the significant lower number of game play)
